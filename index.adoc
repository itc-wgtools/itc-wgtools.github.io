== Introduction
The CCUF established the Team Tools Working Group to work on a set of tools for iTCs. The overall goal is to produce a set of guidance documents on how to use the tools for an iTC and templates for the documents the iTC will need (both to product, such as a cPP and for the processes of managing the iTC itself). The output from this group is intended to be freely available to all iTCs, and will hopefully be maintained over the long term.

The work is being done in GitHub at https://github.com/itc-wgtools/cPP-Tools.

To join the Team Tools WG, please send a message to: ccuf-team-tools-wg@googlegroups.com

To see the calendar for calls/meetings, go to: http://localendar.com/public/itctools

The most recent documents available for review will be posted here when the WG feels they have reached a stable point for external review.

== Current Status
The WG is working towards the completion of the documentation in time for the https://www.iccc2019.com/[ICCC 2019]. As a volunteer effort, it is possible not everything will be completed in time for the conference, but the documents and templates will be prioritized such that the available material should cover the highest needs.

The chart below shows the expected timeline for producing the documents. We are currently in Public Review Phase 1 while working on the Phase 2 Drafts.

=== Review Process
The WG is looking for feedback on the documents being produced here. While there are general timelines we are trying to stick to, we are not establishing specific work and review periods, but are working on a more "rolling" schedule to the target dates. We will welcome comments on any documents or templates posted here at any time as part of our process.

There are two ways to contribute comments and suggestions to the WG. The first is through GitHub, the second by spreadsheet. It should be noted however that comments that are received via the spreadsheet will be added to the GitHub platform to allow for a comprehensive discussion. Also, feedback for comments is only provided via the answers in the GitHub comments. 

Each comment should have a suggested resolution be proposed if a change is needed to the document.

==== GitHub Review Process
To use GitHub to submit comments, you must have a GitHub account (and it is assumed you know how to use GitHub). Each comment should be submitted as an individual https://github.com/itc-wgtools/cPP-Tools/issues[Issue] with the Label "Public Review" assigned. Pull Requests created for any issues will be linked to these Issues for traceability. The documents can be found via the GitHub link.

==== Comment Matrix Spreadsheet Review Process
In the <<SupDocTable>> table there is a link to the Comment Matrix spreadsheet. There are instructions for using the Matrix on the second worksheet. Please create a separate copy of the spreadsheet for each document. The spreadsheets can be mailed to the email address specified at the top of the page.
